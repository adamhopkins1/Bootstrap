BOOTSTRAP CONTAINERS

1.There are three types of containers:

A.Default

B.Responsive

C.Fluid


Bootstrap groups into six categories based on their widths:

EXTRA SMALL (xs)- <576 Pixels.

SMALL (sm) - 576 pixles to <768 pixels.

MEDIUM (md)- 768 pixels to <992 pixels.

LARGE (lg)-992 pixels to <1200 pixels.

EXTRA LARGE (xl) -1200 pixels to <1400 pixels.

EXTRA EXTRA LARGE (xxl) - >=1400 Pixels.

EXAMPLE 1:

A bootstrap break-point is if your screen width is 1280 pixels, Bootstrap will categorize your screen as extra-large. If your screen is 680 pixels, it is considered small.
