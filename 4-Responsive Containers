RESPONISIVE CONTAINERS

1.Responsive containers allow us to alternate between default and fluid containers depending on the screen size.

2.Responsive containers can have full width on smaller but fix the width on wider screens to prevent the content to over-expand.

3. To utilize the responsive container the size categories are used : small (sm), Medium ( md), Large (lg), Extra-Large (xl), and Extra Extra Large (xxl).

EXAMPLE 1:

<div class="container-lg">
...
</div>
